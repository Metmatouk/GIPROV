## Project Details

### Abstract

Amputation is the surgical removal of a specific part or the entire limb (arm, leg, hand, etc.) from the body. An infection, injury, or circulatory disorder in the patient may lead to the need for an amputation. Amputees can use prosthetics to regain their mobility and make their lives easier after losing a limb. However, in some cases, prosthetics do not adapt to the amputee over time, hinder the patients' mobility, and cause pain and discomfort. GİPROV is a software suite that enables the detection of issues faced by amputee patients with prosthetics using artificial intelligence. Using image processing algorithms, the joint points and positions of the amputee patient during movement are detected and sent as input to the artificial neural network. The artificial neural network algorithm, trained with data from previous amputee patients, detects the patient's compatibility and issues with the prosthesis based on the joint and position information provided as input. The entire system has become more accessible thanks to the mobile and computer-compatible application. Tests conducted on the artificial neural network using a doctor-approved dataset and the opinions of amputee patients regarding the functionality of the project have led to the conclusion that GİPROV is quite beneficial for amputee patients. In conclusion, the GİPROV project is a life-enhancing and development-oriented initiative for amputee patients.
